# hask
Code and notes kept as a reference for learning Haskell. Course taking http://www.scs.stanford.edu/14sp-cs240h/

This repository contains code examples of the most relevant haskell features I'm trying to get more and more familiar with.
I ll update it as I learn the language. It will be useful as quick refernce to remind of the syntax or to quickly read trhough that feature again
